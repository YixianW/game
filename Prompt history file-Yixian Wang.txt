HIGH-LEVEL STRATEGY: My strategy was to use Gemini to build a working skeleton first, then iteratively add features like traffic and scoring, and finally apply a specific visual theme. By focusing on a working build at each step, I avoided getting stuck on complex bugs and stayed within the 1-hour limit.
AI TOOL USED: Google Gemini



FULL DIALOGUE LOG

User: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~113/hw2.html Read the requirements for this game. Let’s work through it step by step and build the game together with Python code.

Gemini: Based on the requirements, our goal is to build a "Crossy Road" (or Frogger-style) game in Python using Pygame. We will prioritize the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). I propose Step 1: The Setup and Player Movement. [Code provided: Basic Pygame window with a moving green square] Shall we proceed to Step 2?

User: Can you first tell me your specific steps? What do you plan to design in each step?

Gemini: Here is the 4-step plan to build our MVP:

The Foundation (Player & Grid): Get character moving on a grid.

The Hazard (Traffic): Add cars moving horizontally.

The Rules (Collision & Winning): Add win/loss logic.

The Polish (Endless Mode & Visuals): Add score and colors. We can move immediately to Step 1. [Code provided: crossy_road.py - Step 1 Foundation]

User: OK, let's move to step 2

Gemini: Great, let's implement the traffic. We are adding the Car class and a system to manage them (spawn lanes, speed, direction). [Code provided: crossy_road.py - Step 2 Traffic Added] Ready for Step 3?

User: step 3 please

Gemini: Now we add the rules.

The Crash: Player resets on collision.

The Win: Player reaches top, score +1, resets. [Code provided: crossy_road.py - Step 3 Gameplay Logic] This is officially a game now. Shall we do the final Polish step?

User: yes! do you have any suggestions for the game? make the game more beautiful and playful.

Gemini: To make it beautiful and playful, I suggest:

Vibrant Colors (Pastel palette).

Procedural Graphics (Drawing a Chicken and Cars using shapes instead of squares).

Environment (Grass vs Road strips). [Code provided: crossy_road.py - Step 4 Final Polish (Chicken Version)]

User: Let’s refine the game rules and settings. I want to design this Crossy Road as a soccer-themed game: a soccer ball moves forward, and there are several goals on the opposite side. The cars on the road would be replaced by different players—for example, a goalkeeper spreading their arms to block the ball, and players performing sliding tackles in a few fixed poses. Is this achievable?

Gemini: Yes, that is achievable.

Player -> Soccer Ball.

Obstacles -> Goalkeepers (wide) and Sliding Tacklers (short).

Background -> Soccer field grass. [Code provided: crossy_road.py - Soccer Theme Version]

User: It’s not ideal. Let’s revert to the previous version instead.

Gemini: No problem. Let's stick to the classic Crossy Road style. [Code provided: crossy_road.py - Reverted to Chicken/Traffic Version]

User: Now let’s optimize based on this version. I want to make it Mario-style.

Gemini: Perfect pivot. I will change the aesthetic to 8-bit Mario style.

Player -> Mario sprite (procedural).

Enemies -> Goombas and Bullet Bills.

Colors -> Mario sky blue and ground brown. [Code provided: crossy_road.py - Mario Style V1]

User: good, but not perfect. The black obstacles blend too much with the background and are hard to distinguish. The middle rest areas could include some Mario-style green plants. Mario-style coins can occasionally appear on the road; collecting one gives an extra point. Change the starting and ending background areas to brown brick blocks to mimic a Mario-style design. Add white clouds along the path. The character can stand on them and float left and right with the clouds, and touching clouds will not cause death. Change the scoring rule so that the player must enter a green pipe at the destination to score. Design six green pipes at the finish area.

Gemini: This is a fantastic set of requirements. Key Upgrades:

Better Visibility: Lighter road color.

Moving Clouds: New platform mechanic (rideable).

Coins: Collectible bonus points.

Green Pipes: Specific finish line targets.

Aesthetics: Brick blocks and bushes. [Code provided: crossy_road.py - Mario Style V2 (Coins & Clouds)]

User: Let’s refine it further: After crossing the river, add a green buffer zone where the player can stop and rest. After resting past the river, increase the number of road lanes from one to three, matching the three lanes at the beginning. Make the green pipes at the destination thicker, as they are currently difficult to enter.

Gemini: I will expand the map height to fit the new zones. New Layout: Start -> Road (3 lanes) -> Rest -> River (Clouds) -> Rest (New) -> Road (New 3 lanes) -> Pipes. I also made the pipes wider for easier entry. [Code provided: crossy_road.py - Mario Style V3 (Extended Map)]

User: There are a few bugs in the game now. First, when the character crosses the river and reaches the buffer zone, they die immediately—please fix this bug. Second, while crossing the river, when the character stands on the first cloud lane, they do not move along with the clouds. Finally, the number of clouds is a bit low; please increase it to about 1.2 times the current amount.

Gemini: I found the bugs. They were caused by an off-by-one error in the row index logic. Fixes:

Fixed safe zone logic so you don't die in the new buffer zone.

Fixed cloud attachment logic for the first river lane.

Increased cloud density from 3 to 4 per row. [Code provided: crossy_road.py - Final Corrected Version]
